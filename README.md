# NetIM-Meross Power Consumption Importer
[Alluvio NetIM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/alluvio-netim/) Script to import Power Consumption data from Meross Devices into NetIM to support sustainability initiatives.

## Overview

This NetIM script queries the Meross IOT API, to request the actual power consumption measured by the
[Meross MSS310 Smart Wifi Plug](https://shop.meross.com/products/meross-smart-wifi-plug-with-energy-monitor-mss310-eu-version) from a device 
(such as Desktop PC, Laptop, Server or Network Router). The received data is processed and transmitted for NetIM.
